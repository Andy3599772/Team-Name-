My Student ID is S3670061 and my email is S3670061@student.rmit.edu.au. I am a Sri Lankan born in Colombo, Sri Lanka and I was born to a Buddhist family, hence I am classified as a Buddhist.

My favorite hobbies include playing games, watching videos on YouTube and daydreaming about multitudes of possibilities that might/might not occur. I also like to research random things on the internet when it comes to my mind, like how to code in Python or how to make mini Drones/Rockets or watching any other sort of documentary that I feel like intrigues or interests me. Our team name for this project is “Team Name” since we thought it would be ironic and deadpan funny for a team to have such a name.

**Name**: Harlee Horng

**Student Number**: s3717748

**Email Address**: s3717748@student.rmit.edu.au

**Date of Birth**: 26/12/1999

My name is Harlee Horng, born in Australia in the year of 1999. My nationality is Cambodian as both of my parents are from there. When I was younger, my parents were firm believers of the Buddhism religion, therefore, so was my older sister and me. We would attend events held at the temple on occasions, including the major Chinese New Year festival which took place annually. By the age of 8, I was able to speak the Cambodian language (Khmer) fluently, but the ability to speak it faded away as I grew up and now, I am only able to understand it. Growing up, my family consisted of my mum, dad, sister and me. This changed in the year of 2014, when my dad remarried. A year after the marriage, a little stepsister joined our family who is currently 4 years old and currently attending kindergarten. I had a standard education like most other people, consisting of; kindergarten, primary school, high school and now currently studying at university. I graduated in the year of 2017 with a low ATAR, which required me to complete a year of a diploma course before transferring to a bachelor's degree at RMIT. I acquired my first job at Maccas whilst I was in year 12 and I am still working there right now. As soon as I had enough money to afford a decent computer, I spent all my savings that I had at the time to build my computer. My hobby is playing video games on my PC. One specific game that I enjoy the most is ‘League of Legends’ which I have played consistently and constantly for 6 years.

An interesting fact about me is that I got detention on my first week of primary school because I chased other students around with a stick. Oddly enough, my personality has shifted dramatically from when I was a child. I used to be confident and outgoing, contrasted to how I am now - which is quiet, introverted and antisocial.

**Name**: Andy Lo

**Student Number**: s3599772

**Email Address**: s359772@student.rmit.edu.au

**Date of Birth**: 17/08/1997

My name is Andy Lo, was born in August of 1997. My Student ID is S399772 and my email is S3599772@student.rmit.edu.au. My family is Catholic so attending church on Sunday was a childhood memory for me. I came from Hong Kong to Australia to attend high school and then to RMIT. During this year, I will graduate from bachelor and seek for accounting job. My favourite food is noodles. My hobbies include watching YouTube videos and play mobile games. If there is more time on holiday period, I may travel to a suburb near my home and take a refreshing walk. Our group tried to think of a team name related to Asian as we have a connection with that. Even so, “Team Name” is better, I believe without any specific reason.
